# 🌐 Frontend Projects Collection

This repository is a curated collection of my frontend development work, organized for clarity, reuse, and scalability. It includes:

- 🧱 **HTML/CSS/JS Projects**: Vanilla web pages and interactive components for foundational practice.
- ⚛️ **React Applications**: Functional React apps built with modern development practices.
- 📁 **Shared Assets**: Reusable images, icons, and scripts.
- 🛠 **Utilities**: Shell and Node.js scripts to streamline development and deployment.

Each project is self-contained in its own folder with a dedicated `README.md` explaining setup, features, and usage.

This monorepo is designed for ongoing learning, experimentation, and sharing with others.
